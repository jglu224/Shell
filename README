Description: The program creates a simpler version of the SSH shell which consists
	     of Built-in commands that include setvar, setprompt, setdir, showprocs,
	     and done. The program also accepts the following Program-control commands;
	     run, fly, and tovar. If the user inputs an invalid command
	     or uses the incorrect amount of parameters, an error message will 
	     print to standard error. Throughout the program, we use for loops to search
	     through arrays and vectors. Our code consists of functions declared in the
	     C library which executes, forks, and waits for other programs to complete.
	     We also used strtok() in some instances of tokenizing a string as well as 
	     stringstream. The variable types we used for vectors were strings and integers.
	     There were a few integer variables used  to evaluate conditional statements and 
	     used as counts through loops for vectors and string elements.

Limitations: Our program assumes that if you are using two variable substitutions in a single
	     command then both variables and their values have already been defined.

	Example:	msh > setvar HOME /home/jglu224
			msh > fly echo "^HOME and ^PATH have already been defined."
